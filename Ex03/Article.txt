Crabbe and Goyle chuckled. Harry, who was measuring out powdered spine of lionfish, ignored them. 
Malfoy had been even more unpleasant than usual since the Quidditch match. 
Disgusted that Slytherin had lost, he had tried to get everyone laughing at how a wide-mouthed tree frog would be replacing Harry as Seeker next. 
Then he realised that nobody found this funny, because they were all so impressed at the way Harry had managed to stay on his bucking broomstick.
So Malfoy, jealous and angry, had gone back to taunting Harry about having no proper family.
